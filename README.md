# aperiodic ZSH Theme

This ZSH theme is based heavily on an excellent blog entry from [Phil Gold](http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/). In his blog entry Phil explains detailed how his ZSH theme is working and I can only strongly recommend it to everyone who wants to modify or even generate a new ZSH theme.
